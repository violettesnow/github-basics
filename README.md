# github-basics
A beginner's guide to GitHub.
Suggestions for Your GitHub Basics Explainer Workflow Project
AI Tool Name:  
Suggestion: "GitHub Mentor"  

Reasoning: It’s catchy, descriptive, and implies a guiding role, which fits your workflow’s purpose of teaching GitHub basics. It also ties into the "AI Tutor" theme from your group, suggesting a mentorship vibe powered by AI.

AI Model Name:  
Suggestion: "GPT-3.5 Turbo"  

Reasoning: This is a practical choice for your project. It’s fast, cost-effective, and widely supported by Vercel’s AI SDK (as noted in the system-provided search context). It’s ideal for generating clear, concise explanations for beginners, and it’s accessible via most LLM providers. While GPT-4 or newer models like GPT-4o-mini could work, GPT-3.5 Turbo balances capability and simplicity for your learning context.

Tool Link:  
Suggestion: https://workflows-ai.vercel.app  

Reasoning: This is the base link you’re already using for your project, as specified in your request. Once deployed, your specific workflow would have a unique URL (e.g., https://github-mentor.vercel.app), but for now, this points to the Flows AI platform where you’re building it. It’s the starting point for anyone wanting to explore or replicate your work.

Existing Resource: No exact video exists for this yet, but you could adapt "How to Build an AI App with Vercel AI SDK" (inspired by Vercel’s blog posts like Web ID 16). For a real link, check Vercel’s YouTube channel (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/@VercelHQ) for AI SDK intros, or create your own!
